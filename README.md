# DeepLearningFinal

This repository contains the codebase for our Deep Learning Final Project on Adversarial Attacks.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **DL_P3_abby.ipynb**: Implementation of 
  - Task 1: Basics (ResNet-34 baseline evaluation)
  - Task 2: Pixel-wise attacks (FGSM implementation)

- **DL_P3_ben.ipynb**: Implementation of
  - Task 3: Improved attacks (PGD implementation)
  - Task 4: Patch-based attacks
  - Task 5: Transferring attacks to DenseNet-121

## Project Overview

This project explores adversarial attacks on deep neural networks, specifically targeting ResNet-34 trained on ImageNet. We implement three types of attacks:
1. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)
2. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)
3. Patch-based Attack

We also investigate the transferability of these attacks to DenseNet-121.
